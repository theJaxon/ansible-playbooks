Gitea
=========

Deploy [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) using Helm.

Requirements
------------

- [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) must be the default storage class.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
  - gitea
```
